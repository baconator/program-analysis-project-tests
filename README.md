Pull requests, please! :D This is a convenience repo since sharing patches by email is so 1990s. I'll keep it private until the end of the semester, then send an archived copy of it to the mailing list.

# Usage
1.  Delete/rename the `overflower-template/test` folder.
2.  Go to the `overflower-template` folder. (the one with lib, obj, tools/overflower, etc.)
3.  Run `git clone git@github.com:baconator/project-2-tests.git test`.
